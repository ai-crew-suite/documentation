# Introducing AI Crew Suite

Today we're excited to announce the release of **AI Crew Suite**, an open-source monorepo of eighteen agentic workflow plugins for Spotify's Backstage IDP. This project represents over a year of research and development into safe, deterministic AI automation for platform engineering teams.

## The Problem: AI Agents That Actually Work

Most AI agent frameworks suffer from two critical flaws:

1. **Unbounded execution** - Agents can spin out of control, making unlimited API calls or running up huge LLM bills
2. **Non-deterministic outcomes** - The same input can produce wildly different results, making them unsuitable for production

AI Crew Suite solves both problems through a **deterministic pipeline architecture** where LLMs are used only for narrative synthesis, while tool selection and execution are fully programmatic.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Deterministic Tool Selection

Never let an LLM choose tools. Instead, we use pattern-matching against known query types to select pre-defined tool plans.

```typescript
// BAD: LLM-driven tool selection
const tools = await llm.chooseTools(userQuery);

// GOOD: Programmatic tool selection
const tools = selectToolsByPattern(userQuery, predefinedToolPlans);
```

### 2. Citation-Backed Outputs

Every claim in an agent's output must be traceable to specific evidence. No "trust me, I'm an AI" allowed.

```typescript
const report = {
  findings: [
    {
      claim: "Service latency exceeds SLO",
      evidence: ["metric-p95-latency", "log-timeout-error"],
      confidence: 0.92,
    },
  ],
  rawEvidence: {
    "metric-p95-latency": { type: "metric", value: "p95 > 300ms" },
    "log-timeout-error": {
      type: "log",
      excerpt: "Timeout connecting to database",
    },
  },
};
```

### 3. Bounded Execution

Every agent run has strict resource limits:

- Maximum tool invocations (default: 10)
- Maximum log bytes to read (default: 1MB)
- Maximum context items (default: 20)
- Timeout (default: 5 minutes)

## The Eighteen Plugins

AI Crew Suite includes plugins across four categories:
