      answer:

          <p>
            No. The core orchestration logic is deterministic state machines
            against your project&apos;s reference corpus. LLMs are only used to break
            ties in an explicit confidence band, to summarize, to extract
            entities, and to detect anomalies, each as a swappable,
            model‑agnostic skill.

            If every LLM API went dark tomorrow, you&apos;d still get automated
